**Moving to the East from London**

In this project we are creating a path around the world starting from London. It is only possible to move to one of the three cities that are closest to the current city in our dataset. The main aim is to reach to the easternmost city that is reachable following the given restrictions of movement. At the end, we calculated the total time spent to go to the easternmost city from London
